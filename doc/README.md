Setup
---------------------
[SECI Core](https://github.com/squbs/seci/releases) is the original SECI client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of SECI transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few minutes to hours or a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.
