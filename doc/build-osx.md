Mac OS X Build Instructions and Notes
====================================
The commands in this guide should be executed in a Terminal application.
The built-in one is located in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

Preparation
-----------
Install XCode:

`xcode-select --install` or directly from the app store.

When the popup appears, click the button to get XCode from the app store. Install XCode and open it to accept the license agreement, etc. Then you can close it.

Then install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

Dependencies
----------------------

    brew install automake berkeley-db4 libtool boost miniupnpc openssl pkg-config protobuf python qt libevent qrencode

See [dependencies.md](dependencies.md) for a complete overview.

If you want to build the disk image with `make deploy` (.dmg / optional), you need RSVG

    brew install librsvg

NOTE: Building with Qt4 is still supported, however, could result in a broken UI. Building with Qt5 is recommended.

Berkeley DB
-----------
It is recommended to use Berkeley DB 4.8.

**Note**: You only need Berkeley DB if the wallet is enabled (see the section *Disable-Wallet mode* below).

Build seci Core
------------------------

1. Clone the seci source code and cd into `seci`

        git clone https://github.com/seci-coin/seci
        cd seci

2.  Build seci-core:

    Configure and build the headless seci binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).

    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.

        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make

3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests:

        make check

4.  You can also create a .dmg that contains the .app bundle (optional):

        make deploy

Running
-------

Seci QT is now available at `seci/src/qt/seci-qt`. Opening this fill will open the standard QT GUI wallet.

Seci Core is now available at `seci/src/secid`

Before running Seci Core, it's recommended you create an RPC configuration file.

    echo -e "rpcuser=secirpc\nrpcpassword=$(xxd -l 16 -p /dev/urandom)" > "/Users/${USER}/Library/Application Support/seci/seci.conf"

    chmod 600 "/Users/${USER}/Library/Application Support/seci/seci.conf"

The first time you run secid, it will start downloading the blockchain. This process could take several hours.

You can monitor the download process by looking at the debug.log file:

    tail -f $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/seci/debug.log

Other commands:
-------

    ./src/secid -daemon # Starts the seci daemon.
    ./src/seci-cli --help # Outputs a list of command-line options.
    ./src/seci-cli help # Outputs a list of RPC commands when the daemon is running.

Notes
-----

* Tested on OS X 10.8 through 10.13 on 64-bit Intel processors only.

* Building with downloaded Qt binaries is not officially supported.
